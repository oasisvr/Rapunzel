<p>This is the story of how I died.<br>
But don't worry, this is actually very fun story.<br>
And the truth is, it isn't even mine.<br>
This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel.<br>
And it starts with the sun.<br>
Now, once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.<br>
And from this small drop of sun, grew a magic golden flower.<br>
It had the ability to heal the sick and injured.<br>
Oh, you see that old woman over there?<br>
You might want to remember her.<br>
She's kind of important.<br>
Well, centuries passed and a hop, skip and a boat ride away, there grew a
kingdom.<br>
The kingdom was ruled by beloved King and Queen.<br>
And the Queen, well she was about to have a baby, but she got sick. Really sick.<br>
