<H2>Her mom sick</H2>
<p>She was running out of time.<br>
And that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.<br>
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.<br>
Ahhh, I told you she'd be important.<br>
You see, instead of sharing the sun’s gift, this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its
healing power and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.<br>
And all she had to do, was sing a special song.<br>
* Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine.<br>
* Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.<br>
* What once was mine.<br>
All right, you get the gist.<br>
She sings to it, she turns young, creepy, right?<br>
We found it!<br>
The magic of the golden flower, healed the Queen.<br>
A healthy baby girl, a princess was born with beautiful golden hair.<br>
I'll give you a hint. That’s Rapunzel.<br>
To celebrate her birth, the King and Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.<br>
And for that one moment, everything was perfect.<br>
And then that moment ended.<br>
* Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine.<br>
* Make the clock re… huh!<br>
Gothel broke into the castle, stole the child, and just like that … gone!<br>
The kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the princess.<br>
For deep within the forest, in a hidden tower, Gothel raised the child as her own.<br>
* Save what has been lost.<br>
* Bring back what once was mine. What once was mine.<br>
Gothel had found her new magic flower.<br>
But this time she was determined to keep it hidden.<br>
Why can't I go outside?<br>
The outside world is a dangerous place filled with horrible, selfish people.<br>
You must stay here where you're safe.<br>
Do you understand, flower?<br>
Yes, Mommy.<br>
But the walls of that tower could not hide everything.<br>
Each year on her birthday, the King and Queen released thousands of lanterns
into the sky.<br>
In hope that one day, their lost princess would return.<br>
